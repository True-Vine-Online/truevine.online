CADS

Welcome to Cloud Advertisement Delivery System, or CADS. CADS is a JavaScript built advertisement delivery system for use on Truevine Online’s websites as well as third party sites. 

Goals

• Plugin 
CADS needs to act as a plugin. This way we can host ads on other sites that we do not own, which will make our marketing platform more desirable for customers as it broadens our reach.

• Open-source
We can safely offer our code open-source as what customers will be paying for is access to our ad hosting network, not the actual code. Open-source code will help build consumer trust as consumers will be able to conduct privacy audits of our product and see that we really do respect their privacy.
